### About me
I've done Software Quality Assurance for over 5 years and have been the cause of at least 1 confirmed tear shed from a developer.

I've had the luxury of working on projects ranging from [pizza 🍕](littlecaesars.com) to [drones 🚁](riis.com) and quite a bit inbetween 
courtesy of startups that didn't end up starting up! 

Over here you'll generally find some scripts that I use in a day-to-day basis while testing as well as some old projects that I wrote
to learn something new or briefly test something on a project.
